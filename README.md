# Git Demo 2

This is a repository for practicing pull requests.

## What to do

1. You will fork this project by clicking on the "fork" button on the top right corner, at which point your should have your own forked version of this project under your account on Github.
2. Clone this project to your local computer.
3. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b a-branch-name`. Replace a-branch-name with a descriptive name of your choice.
4. Do `git status` to see that you are indeed on this branch.
5. Make a couple of commits to this branch. I suggest adding a file of your choice, and then committing another change to that file.
6. Push the changes to GitHub: `git push -u origin a-branch-name`, again replacing a-branch-name with the name of your branch.
7. Go to github.com, find your project. You should see your new branch in a peach colored box under "Your recently pushed branches:". Click the "Compare & Pull request" button on the right. Leave a comment, and click "Create pull request".
8. That's it! Next step is to wait for your instructor to accept (or reject) your pull request. There is also the option of leaving comments on the pull request page as a means of code review.
